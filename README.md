# tf2java_example

Experiment in models built by tensorflow in python, and loaded into java  

(Examples all use [tensorflow 1.8](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/))

## models by python tensorflow

* [model (graph)](model/by_graph) -- [save_model.py](python/save_model.py) & [load_model.py](load_model.py)


## models loaded by java tensorflow

* [tensorflow java api](java/tensorflow)  ( mvn compile exec:java -q )
* [dl4j (deeplearning4j)](java/dl4j) *todo*
